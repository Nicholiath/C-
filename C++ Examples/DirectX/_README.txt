This is a 3D DirectX engine in C++ I created this week following and learning alongside a guide. It is not a direct representation of my skills, as it was not coded off the top of my head, but I felt it would be good practice as it may be a tool used at your company, and to show that I do have knowledge in this area and am capable of generate graphics in C++.
