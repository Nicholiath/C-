This is a server that allows a client to view the contents of a requested directory on the server's computer.

Run Server in one Linux shell, such as Cygwin, and Client in another. Enter a desired directory, for example "C:\" (include colon and slash), and the client will receive a list of the files and folders contained within that directory.
